 * This is an alternative to Core's `.alignfull` class, but works very differently.

 * If the Core class works for a given situation, it's probably better to use that than this. There are some
 * situations where you can't apply that class, or it doesn't work well, though (e.g., the yellow banner in the
 * header).
 *
 * @todo This is probably making some assumptions about how it will be used in the header, so may not be ready to
 * use as a general purpose class across the site.
